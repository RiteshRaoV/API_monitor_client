# Product Requirements Document: API Monitor Client

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Goal/Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust API Monitoring Client that allows for efficient log ingestion, detailed analytics, and insightful monitoring of various API endpoints. The system should provide developers and administrators with the tools to track API performance, identify issues, and ensure reliability.

### 1.2. Target Audience
-   Developers
-   DevOps Engineers
-   System Administrators
-   Product Managers

## 2. Project Milestones & Features

### 2.1. Core Setup & Configuration
-   [x] Initialize Django Project Structure
-   [x] Configure Environment-Specific Settings (`base.py`, `local.py`, `production.py`)
-   [ ] Set up `core` app for shared logic
-   [ ] Implement basic project-wide utilities in `core.utils`
-   [ ] Configure static file serving (`/static/`)
-   [ ] Set up version control (e.g., Git) and `.gitignore`

### 2.2. Log Ingestion (`apps/logs`)
-   [ ] **M1: Define Log Data Model:**
    -   [ ] Design `LogEntry` model (fields: `app_name`, `endpoint`, `method`, `status_code`, `latency_ms`, `timestamp`, `client_ip`, `request_body`, `response_body`, `user_agent`, `correlation_id`)
    -   [ ] Implement migrations for the `LogEntry` model.
-   [ ] **M2: Implement Log Ingestion API:**
    -   [ ] Create DRF Serializer for incoming log data.
    -   [ ] Implement field-level validation (`validate_<field>`) for all required fields.
    -   [ ] Develop API View (`LogIngestView`) to accept structured JSON logs.
    -   [ ] Ensure the endpoint is `/api/logs/ingest/`.
-   [ ] **M3: Storage & Indexing:**
    -   [ ] Configure database (PostgreSQL recommended for structured data, consider MongoDB for flexible schema if needed).
    -   [ ] Implement efficient indexing on `LogEntry` model (e.g., `timestamp`, `app_name`, `endpoint`, `status_code`).
-   [ ] **M4: Error Handling & Logging:**
    -   [ ] Implement custom logging for errors during the ingestion process.
    -   [ ] Ensure failed ingestion attempts are logged with sufficient detail for debugging.

### 2.3. Analytics & Insights (`apps/analytics`)
-   [ ] **M1: Basic Log Data Retrieval API:**
    -   [ ] Create DRF ViewSet (`LogDataViewSet`) for accessing log data.
    -   [ ] Implement filtering capabilities using `django-filter` (filter by: `timestamp` range, `app_name`, `endpoint`, `method`, `status_code`).
-   [ ] **M2: Aggregations & Grouping:**
    -   [ ] Extend `LogDataViewSet` to support grouping (e.g., by `app_name`, `endpoint`, `status_code`).
    -   [ ] Implement aggregations (e.g., average latency, count of requests, error count, success rate).
-   [ ] **M3: Graph-Ready Data Endpoints:**
    -   [ ] Endpoint for latency trends over time (e.g., `/api/analytics/latency-trend/`).
    -   [ ] Endpoint for error rate over time (e.g., `/api/analytics/error-rate-trend/`).
    -   [ ] Endpoint for request volume per endpoint (e.g., `/api/analytics/request-volume/`).
    -   [ ] Ensure data is formatted suitably for charting libraries.
-   [ ] **M4: Query Optimization:**
    -   [ ] Review and optimize all database queries for performance.
    -   [ ] Avoid N+1 query problems and full-table scans where possible.

### 2.4. Core Services (`apps/core`)
-   [ ] **M1: Shared Validators:**
    -   [ ] Implement common data validators in `core/validators.py` (e.g., for IP addresses, specific string formats).
    -   [ ] Ensure validators raise `ValidationError` on failure.
-   [ ] **M2: Middleware (Optional - As Needed):**
    -   [ ] Implement lightweight custom middleware if required (e.g., for custom request header processing, request timing).
    -   [ ] Ensure middleware is async-safe if applicable.
-   [ ] **M3: Encryption (Optional - If Sensitive Data is Logged):**
    -   [ ] Implement encryption/decryption functions in `core/encryption.py`.
    -   [ ] Write unit tests for encryption logic.

### 2.5. Testing
-   [ ] **M1: Unit Tests for Log Ingestion:**
    -   [ ] Test `LogEntry` model creation.
    -   [ ] Test `LogIngestSerializer` validation (valid and invalid data).
    -   [ ] Test `LogIngestView` endpoint (success and failure cases).
-   [ ] **M2: Unit Tests for Analytics:**
    -   [ ] Test `LogDataViewSet` filtering.
    -   [ ] Test aggregation and grouping logic.
    -   [ ] Test data format from graph-ready endpoints.
-   [ ] **M3: Unit Tests for Core App:**
    -   [ ] Test validators.
    -   [ ] Test utility functions.
    -   [ ] Test middleware and encryption (if implemented).
-   [ ] **M4: Integration Tests:**
    -   [ ] Test the flow from log ingestion to analytics retrieval.

### 2.6. Documentation
-   [ ] **M1: API Documentation:**
    -   [ ] Set up Swagger/OpenAPI documentation (`docs/`).
    -   [ ] Ensure all API endpoints are documented with request/response schemas and examples.
-   [ ] **M2: Project README:**
    -   [ ] Update `README.md` with setup instructions, project overview, and contribution guidelines.

### 2.7. Deployment & Operations
-   [ ] **M1: Dockerization:**
    -   [ ] Create `Dockerfile` for the Django application.
    -   [ ] Create `docker-compose.yml` for local development and services (DB, app).
-   [ ] **M2: Production Configuration:**
    -   [ ] Configure Gunicorn as the WSGI server.
    -   [ ] Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy and for serving static files.
    -   [ ] Ensure production settings are secure and optimized.
-   [ ] **M3: CI/CD Pipeline (Optional):**
    -   [ ] Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
-   [ ] **Performance:** Log ingestion should be fast; analytics queries should be responsive.
-   [ ] **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a growing volume of logs.
-   [ ] **Reliability:** The system should be stable and minimize data loss.
-   [ ] **Security:** Protect sensitive data (if any) and secure API endpoints.
-   [ ] **Maintainability:** Code should be well-organized, documented, and follow PEP8.

## 4. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)
-   [ ] Real-time alerting system for critical API issues.
-   [ ] Advanced anomaly detection in API traffic.
-   [ ] User authentication and role-based access control for the monitoring dashboard.
-   [ ] Customizable dashboards.
-   [ ] Integration with third-party notification services (Slack, PagerDuty).
