# Analytics Rules

- Expose APIs to fetch filtered log data based on time, endpoint, method, status, etc.
- Use DRF ViewSets and filters (`django-filter`).
- Support grouping (e.g., by app_name, endpoint) and aggregations (e.g., avg latency).
- Provide endpoints for graph-ready data (e.g., latency trends, error rate).
- Optimize queries â€” avoid full-table scans.
