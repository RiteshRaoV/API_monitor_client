# Log Ingestion Rules

- Accept structured JSON logs from SDKs.
- Validate fields such as `endpoint`, `method`, `status_code`, `latency`, and `timestamp`.
- Use DRF serializers with `validate_<field>` for field-level validation.
- Model logs efficiently with proper indexing (e.g., timestamp, app_name).
- Use custom logging to debug ingestion errors.
