# Core Logic Rules

- Place only shared, reusable logic here.
- Encryption-related functions must be in `core/encryption.py` and unit-tested.
- Middleware must not block requests â€” use async-safe practices.
- Validators go in `core/validators.py` and must raise `ValidationError` on failure.
- Avoid app-specific logic in `core/`.
